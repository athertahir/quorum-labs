Cakeshop is a set of tools and APIs for working with an Ethereum-based blockchain, packaged as a Java web application archive (WAR) that can be dropped into any application server and gets you up and running in under 60 seconds.

Cakeshop can either start up a geth node, which you can then interact with using the Cakeshop front-end, or it can be connected to an Ethereum-like node, such as [Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum), that you already have running.  A given Cakeshop instance connects with one node on the blockchain network you connect to.

Out of the box you get:
* Fully functioning **Ethereum node** (via geth)
* Working **Solidity Smart Contract compiler**
* **Dashboard UI** for controlling your node and setting up a cluster
* Contract **Sandbox** (Solidity IDE & REPL)
* **Contract Explorer** (high level data view)
* **Blockchain Explorer** (low level data view)
* **Peer** Manager
* **RESTful APIs** & documentation

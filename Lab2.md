# 5 nodes Real-time Gross Settlement 

This example configures 5 nodes, each with their own PrivateTransactionManager. Usage:

  - `raft-init.sh`: Initialize accounts and keystores
  - `raft-start.sh`: Launch `constellation` and `geth` nodes, then send a private transaction
  - `stop.sh`: Stop all `constellation` and `geth` nodes

All logs and temporary data will be written to the `qdata` folder.

## The blockchain Real-time Gross Setlement (RTGS) problem
RTGS systems are very dependent of a central entity, but this design creates a single point of failure. Backup datacenters can help but do not solve the problem completely as there is no real distributed resiliency when using only backup infrastructures. The distributed consensus nature of the blockchain technology can be used to overcome this central point of failure, but at a great privacy cost as all stored data are fully accessible to all network members by default, and this kind of transparency is not allowed in a real bank interpayment network. Quorum privacy properties were used to overcome this problem when implementing a blockchain RTGS system. This example uses Quorum private and public smart contract communication.

## Smart contracts
There are two smart contracts in this example, both stored in the contracts.sol file and lightly commented:

1- bankContract

This contract implements the main logic of the RTGS system. One PRIVATE instance of the contract must be deployed for EACH participating bank on the network and it will store private transaction data and balance. It has many verification steps to avoid bank personification, fraud and overdraft transactions. Most of the checks are made by the contract itself, but the overdraft protection must be made by an active regulator node. 

2- regulatorTransactionList

This contract stores and serves the public data to the private contracts. Examples of the public data are transactions hashes and participating banks information.

## Transaction confirmation logic
Transactions are published privately by the sender bank and must only be sent to the recipient and to the regulator nodes (privateFor parameter). They are created in an UNCONFIRMED state and are only final if they are confirmed. After publishing the private transaction, the sender bank must publish the same transaction hash in the public transaction log (regulatorTransactionList public contract) to ensure that all the parts are aware of the transaction. Transactions can only be confirmed and reflect on bank balances if they are stored in the public transaction log and they can be confirmed by two ways:

1- By the regulator calling the confirmTransactionRegulator function

2- By the sender bank calling confirmTransactionBank function. This function ensures that the confirmation timer has expired before confirming the transaction. 

This two phase commit is needed because there is no overdraft protecting in the bankContract code because different bank instances have different data. For example, bank1 smart contract published in the bank1 node has the balance variable set, but the same contract with the same address in the bank2 node has no value in the balance data because this data is private to bank1 and the regulator. The regulator nodeÂ´s contracts have all the data as it must be part of every private transaction. The logic behind this proccess is that, after a transaction is published, the regulator can check the sender balance against the newly published transaction. If the value intended for the transfer is higher than the bank balance, the regulator must block this transaction during the confirmation time. If the value is below the balance OR if the regulator is offline, the sender bank can confirm its own transaction after the confirmation time. This is a resiliency feature to ensure that the RTGS system endures a regulator outage.

## Environment setup

2- Run "bootstrap.sh" script to install Constellation, GO and Quorum(Already done in previous lab).
 
## Quorum set up and start
1- call raft-init.sh to initialize accounts and keystores

2- Bring the 5 nodes up calling start.sh

3- Connect to the nodes calling:

terminal 1: ``$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd1/geth.ipc``

terminal 2: ``$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd2/geth.ipc``

terminal 3: ``$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd3/geth.ipc``

terminal 4: ``$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd4/geth.ipc``

terminal 5: ``$ geth attach ipc:qdata/dd5/geth.ipc``

Terminal 1-3 are banks 1-3, terminal 4 is the regulator and terminal 5 is the observer used to test privacy.

## Running 5nodesRTGS example
4- Run the following command three times in the javascript quorum console on terminal 4 (regulator):
 
``loadScript("deploy-bankContract-0-3-6.js");``

The script uses a solidity 0.3.6 precompiled bytecode because of quorum issue 82 (https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/issues/82).

4.1- If you receive an error like "Error: Non-200 status code: &{Status:500 Internal Server Error", wait for the constellation nodes to know their peers. In my low end lab it can take a while (some minutes).

5- Take note of the 3 bank contract addresses. It can take some seconds, but the geth console will eventually provide an output like "Contract mined! address: 0x...". These are bank1, bank2 and bank3 private contracts instances addresses.

6- Run the following command one time in the javascript console on terminal 4 (regulator): 

``loadScript("deploy-regulatorTransactionList-0-3-6.js");``

7- Take note of the contract address. It is the public transaction log contract address.

8- Run the following script in each of the five javascript quorum consoles (all terminals). Change the first 4 lines using the addresses written before. The addresses must be between double quotes (I.e. "0x937540f5002fd57b0111e049f2da603fcaec78b8").

9- You should see "0" as return to all contract balances calls on every node. It is fine, the contracts are still empty.

10- Run the script below ONLY on regulator node (node 4), it will initialize all the basic data in all contracts like the public transaction log address, who is the regulator node, etc.

```

## Testing Privacy

1- Run the script below on every terminal.
```
contract1.balance()
contract2.balance()
contract3.balance()
```

2- Terminals 1-3 should only have its respective bank balance, i.e., terminal 1 output must be:
```
> contract1.balance()
> 10000
> contract2.balance()
> 0
> contract3.balance()
> 0
```

Terminal 4 (regulator) output must be:
```
> contract1.balance()
> 10000
> contract2.balance()
> 20000
> contract3.balance()
> 30000
```

## Testing transactions confirmed by the regulator
Testing a transaction where bank1 sends 10 to bank2:
1- Issue the command below on terminal 1:
``contract1.sendValue(address2,10,"random1",{from:eth.coinbase,gas:500000,privateFor:["R56gy4dn24YOjwyesTczYa8m5xhP6hF2uTMCju/1xkY=","QfeDAys9MPDs2XHExtc84jKGHxZg/aj52DTh0vtA3Xc="]});``

2- Wait until this transaction is mined. After some seconds, you should see a non zero hash after issuing: ``contract1.transactionIDs(0)`` on terminal 1.

3- Write the transaction hash to the public transaction log issuing ``contracttr.addTransaction(contract1.transactionIDs(0),{from:eth.coinbase,gas:500000});`` on terminal 1.

4- Check that only bank1, bank2 and the regulator can see the private transaction data issuing ``contract1.transactionIDs(0)`` on all terminals. Bank3 and observer nodes have no private data of this transaction.

5- Check that the public transaction data is available to all nodes issuing ``contracttr.transactions(contract1.transactionIDs(0))`` on all nodes. They all have knowledge of the existance of a transaction with this hash, but have no access to the private data.

6- The regulator transaction confirmation: Issue the command below in the regulator node (terminal 4):
``contract1.confirmTransactionRegulator(contract1.transactionIDs(0),{from:eth.coinbase,gas:500000,privateFor:["QfeDAys9MPDs2XHExtc84jKGHxZg/aj52DTh0vtA3Xc=","BULeR8JyUWhiuuCMU/HLA0Q5pzkYT+cHII3ZKBey3Bo="]});``

7- Check that the balances of bank1 and bank2 are updated privately by inter private contracts function calls.
```
contract1.balance()
contract2.balance()
```

## Testing transactions confirmed by the sender bank
1- Repeat steps 1-5 above. Remember that the index of the transaction is updated, so commands like ``contract1.transactionIDs(0)`` must be changed to ``contract1.transactionIDs(1)``.

2- Wait at least the confirmation time seconds (default 60);

3- The bank self-confirmation: Issue the command below in the sender bank node (terminal 1). Remember to update the transactionID index as needed.
``contract1.confirmTransactionBank(contract1.transactionIDs(1),{from:eth.coinbase,gas:500000,privateFor:["R56gy4dn24YOjwyesTczYa8m5xhP6hF2uTMCju/1xkY=","QfeDAys9MPDs2XHExtc84jKGHxZg/aj52DTh0vtA3Xc="]});``

## Testing transactions blocking
1- Repeat steps 1-5 of the "Testing transactions confirmed by the regulator" steps. Remember that the index of the transaction is updated, so commands like ``contract1.transactionIDs(1)`` must be changed to ``contract1.transactionIDs(2)``.

2- Block the transaction issuing the command below in the regulator node (terminal 4):
``contracttr.blockTransaction(contract1.transactionIDs(2),{from:eth.coinbase,gas:500000});``

3- Try to confirm the transaction, either by the sender bank after confirmation time or by the regulator. It must not work.

4- Unblock the transaction issuing the command below in the regulator node (terminal 4):
``contracttr.unblockTransaction(contract1.transactionIDs(2),{from:eth.coinbase,gas:500000});``

5- Now the transaction can be confirmed.

## Other functions
Banks can be blocked entirely using the blockBank function in the regulatorTransactionList contract.
